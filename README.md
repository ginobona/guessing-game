# guessing-game
This game works by giving encouragement and compliments to people who play the guitar.
The user is prompted to answer a question about how many hours they've played the guitar.
If the user answers 0, they will receive a message telling them they really need to start playing the guitar.
If the user answers 1 - 199, they will receive a message encouraging them to keep practicing and soon they'll be on stage.
If the user answers 200 or more, they will receive a complimentary message about how they shred like Joe Satriani.
